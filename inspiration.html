<h1> WHAT IF YOU HAVE GIVEN ENOUGH TIME AND MONEY WHAT DO YOU DO</h1>
<p>
      <h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>people look at their bank accounts with great attention and assess how much money they have to spend, 
 to invest, and to give away.<br>But they don’t look at their time the same way, and end up wasting this incredibly valuable resource.<br>
<br> In fact, time is much more valuable than money because you can use your time to make money, but you can’t use money to purchase more time.<br>

<br>Time is the great equalizer. Each day has only 24 hours—nobody has any more than anyone else.<br>
 <br>Everyone, from poets to presidents, fills those hours, one after the other, until they are all filled up.<br>
 <br>Every single minute is unique, and once gone, can never be regained.<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>When you look at someone who has accomplished a lot, you can be pretty sure that <br>he or she has spent considerable amounts of time mastering the required skills,<br> 
<br>filling hours upon hours with hard work. There are those who look at others’ accomplishments and say, “I had that idea," or “I could have done that.”<br>
<br>But ideas are cheap and intentions are just that. If you don’t invest the time needed to achieve those goals then all you have are empty ambitions.<br>

<br>People often say, “I don’t have the time to …” Fill in the blank with whatever you like: exercise, make dinner, write a book, start a company, run for political office.<br>
<br> What makes these people think that they have less time than anyone else? Of course they don’t.<br>
<br> We all have the same 24 hours in each day and make real decisions about how we spend them.<br>
<br> If you really want to get in shape, then carve out time to exercise.<br>
 <br>If you want to write a book, then pick up a pen and do it. And, if you want to run for president, then get started.<br> 
<br>It isn’t going to happen if you plan your day around your favorite TV shows or spend hours updating your Facebook page.<br>
<br> These are entertaining distractions that eat up your irreplaceable time.<br>
