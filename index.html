<p4>For every person they have their own ideas about their life,<br>Every person should plan their next life what it should be
You want to do something that may change your life  style<br> if you have time 
Money can give us the power to make a difference in the lives of others, but not the desire to do so.</p4>

<p>It can give us the time to develop and nurture our relationships, but not the love and caring necessary to do so
It can just as easily make us jaded, escapist, selfish, and lonely,How much do you need? What is it going to cost you to get it?

<p>It is keeping these two questions in mind that gives us a true sense of money's relationship to happiness. 
If we have less than what we need,
or if what we have is costing us too much, we can never be happy.
We need money to eat, sleep, dress, work, play, relate, heal, move about, and enjoy comforts
We should remember in choosing our style that it comes with a price tag.

Get off your phones
Do fun stuff,when you are not in a good 
            mood at work(or) life
Whatever is disturbing you just let it go
              What if you have enough money What do you do
              Just save your money on something
              Or invest on something it doesn’t  effect in future
              The effect of your choices by
              Your way of thinking

    <h1 style="background-color:Tomato;">will you do if you have both time and money
        Is time is money</h1>
    Those who save time will save money too
    Then those who earn their own money and own other
            people’s time too
    Ex:social web sites 
    <h1 style="background-color:Tomato;">value</h1> 
    What you make the bigger you perform the more you score

    <h1 style="background-color: Tomato;">Quality </h1>
    Investing time can save money if you invest it in quality products
    No matter how much you earn ,the most valuable thing you have is your time
